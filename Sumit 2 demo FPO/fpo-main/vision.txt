NAFPO aims to make Farmer Producer Organisation (FPOs) resilient for farmer prosperity.

We drive the interests further of small and marginal farmers of India, various Farmer Producer Organizations in all forms, their associative tiers like state bodies and associated organizations. Our aim is to facilitate FPOs to function as collectives promoting the interest of their members while addressing larger challenges such as sustainable agriculture for livelihoods, resource conservation and regeneration and promoting an equitable and inclusive model of rural economic growth.
